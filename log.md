# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: TL;DR: Learning Python Basics. 

Been following [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) this morning, struggled a bit with lint errors in the code. I felt that I needed to understand the Python language better so I went to [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). Even this felt a bit annoying to me since I didn't grasp how to run python script files yet. Everything in the tutorial was done with the interpreter, which annoyed me since when I made a mistake I had to retype a bunch of lines of code. So I detoured and found a tutorial on how to simply run a .py file and found it was very easy. 

Finally I sat down and wrote a simple module sample so I got a hang of using "python -m moduleName" for importing classes and running initialization and/or main code. Surprisingly simple. Today has been **much more** of learning than actually writing code.

**Thoughts:** It feels like a lot of work to get things sorted with #100DaysOfCode considering I haven't used tools like git for a long time. Excited about learning Python. Feeling slightly daunted about gitignores and settings. Unsure about "proper" project setup.

### Day 1: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: TL;DR: Learning Python Basics. Been reading [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python". Read about 13 pages after a recommendation from a user in the #100DaysOfCode discord channel for python learners. I copied a program in the book by typing it out and slightly modifying it and the code makes sense. The program accepts user input as grades (A+, C, F etc) and calculates a score based on the number of grades and the weighted points of those grades. Not very useful for me, but still nice to have something to do.

**Update**: I found [Practice Python website](https://www.practicepython.org/) to help with issuing things for me to code on. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like I still haven't found a good starting point for Python. The book seems to relate around data structures but I'd like a book that focuses more on Python, the language and modules that come with it. I want to learn more about how pip and venv works. Git usage is not daunting at this point. Today (at the point of writing) I muscled less reading, kind of feeling a little demotivated due to feeling unsure about the content I'm learning from.
