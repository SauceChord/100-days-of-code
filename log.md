# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: TL;DR: Learning Python Basics. 

Been following [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) this morning, struggled a bit with lint errors in the code. I felt that I needed to understand the Python language better so I went to [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). Even this felt a bit annoying to me since I didn't grasp how to run python script files yet. Everything in the tutorial was done with the interpreter, which annoyed me since when I made a mistake I had to retype a bunch of lines of code. So I detoured and found a tutorial on how to simply run a .py file and found it was very easy. 

Finally I sat down and wrote a simple module sample so I got a hang of using "python -m moduleName" for importing classes and running initialization and/or main code. Surprisingly simple. Today has been **much more** of learning than actually writing code.

**Thoughts:** It feels like a lot of work to get things sorted with #100DaysOfCode considering I haven't used tools like git for a long time. Excited about learning Python. Feeling slightly daunted about gitignores and settings. Unsure about "proper" project setup.
